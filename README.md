# Thread and Semaphore In C
Thread and Semaphore In the C11 Programming Language

<br />

This project encapsulates virtual memory allocation, thread and semaphore operations so that these operations can be used in both Windows and Unix-like operating systems directly.

It also demonstrates how to properly use these functions.

For Windows, the solution is built with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. For Unix-like operating systems, execute `sh linux-build.sh` command to build the project, and GCC 9 or later versions are recommended.
